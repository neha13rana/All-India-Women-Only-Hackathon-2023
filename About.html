    <h2 >We're on a mission to improve city travel in a way that's good for the planet. As cities grow and more people use cars, we see problems like traffic jams, pollution, and more carbon emissions. We want to fix that by offering sustainable solutions for a cleaner and more efficient urban environment.</h2>

    <h2>To make this happen, we've created an interactive map that lets you enter your city and find the best routes. These routes are fast and eco-friendly, making it easier for you to choose sustainable ways to get around. You can also create an account to get personalized travel suggestions just for you.</h2>

    <h2>We believe in informed choices, so we've made a carbon footprint calculator. This tool helps you see how much your transportation affects the environment. With this knowledge, we hope to inspire you to be part of building a sustainable future.</h2>
